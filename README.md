ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset
------------------------------------

The ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset consists of two collections of heartbeat signals obtained from well-known datasets: the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. This dataset is commonly used for heartbeat classification tasks and is suitable for training deep neural networks.

Abstract
--------
The dataset contains preprocessed and segmented electrocardiogram (ECG) signals representing different types of heartbeats, including normal cases and those affected by arrhythmias and myocardial infarction. It has been widely utilized to explore the capabilities of deep neural network architectures and investigate transfer learning techniques.

Arrhythmia Dataset
------------------
- Number of Samples: 109,446
- Number of Categories: 5
- Sampling Frequency: 125Hz
- Data Source: Physionet's MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset
- Classes: ['N': 0, 'S': 1, 'V': 2, 'F': 3, 'Q': 4]

The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database
-------------------------------
- Number of Samples: 14,552
- Number of Categories: 2
- Sampling Frequency: 125Hz
- Data Source: Physionet's PTB Diagnostic Database

Please note that the dataset is labeled, and each segment within it corresponds to a specific heartbeat.
